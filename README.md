## Quick Start

#### 3. (Optional) Configure the models you want to use

In your editor's AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Change the main, research and fallback models to <model_name>, <model_name> and <model_name> respectively.
```

For example, to use Claude Code (no API key required):
```txt
Change the main model to claude-code/sonnet
```

#### 4. Initialize Task Master

In your editor's AI chat pane, say:

```txt
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

#### 5. Make sure you have a PRD (Recommended)

For **new projects**: Create your PRD at `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`  
For **existing projects**: You can use `scripts/prd.txt` or migrate with `task-master migrate`

An example PRD template is available after initialization in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt`.

> [!NOTE]
> While a PRD is recommended for complex projects, you can always create individual tasks by asking "Can you help me implement [description of what you want to do]?" in chat.

**Always start with a detailed PRD.**

The more detailed your PRD, the better the generated tasks will be.

#### 6. Common Commands

Use your AI assistant to:

- Parse requirements: `Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?`
- Plan next step: `What's the next task I should work on?`
- Implement a task: `Can you help me implement task 3?`
- View multiple tasks: `Can you show me tasks 1, 3, and 5?`
- Expand a task: `Can you help me expand task 4?`
- **Research fresh information**: `Research the latest best practices for implementing JWT authentication with Node.js`
- **Research with context**: `Research React Query v5 migration strategies for our current API implementation in src/api.js`

### Option 2: Using Command Line

#### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# OR install locally within your project
npm install task-master-ai
```

#### Initialize a new project

```bash
# If installed globally
task-master init

# If installed locally
npx task-master init

# Initialize project with specific rules
task-master init --rules cursor,windsurf,vscode
```

This will prompt you for project details and set up a new project with the necessary files and structure.

#### Common Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Show specific task(s) - supports comma-separated IDs
task-master show 1,3,5

# Research fresh information with project context
task-master research "What are the latest best practices for JWT authentication?"

# Generate task files
task-master generate

# Add rules after initialization
task-master rules add windsurf,roo,vscode
```

## Claude Code Support

Task Master now supports Claude models through the Claude Code CLI, which requires no API key:

- **Models**: `claude-code/opus` and `claude-code/sonnet`
- **Requirements**: Claude Code CLI installed
- **Benefits**: No API key needed, uses your local Claude instance
